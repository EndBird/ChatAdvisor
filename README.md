The app works simply by loading it on Visual Studio and running it on localhost. Load the project using the sln file.  The first time you download the project make sure to unzip and extract everything.  Create a new user account and another one to have both talk to each other.  On my machine, the user Minh with password Admin is also saved in the app, to start with.
